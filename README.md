# The Elements of Computing Systems - Nand2Tetris

This repo contains (will contain) my implementation of Nand2Tetris, both with the typical emulated hardware, and a reimplementation of the hardware, etc. in whatever programming languages I want in the future.

It'll just be the one repo, at least as long as I remember that I intended to put everything in the one repo. YMMV.
